# PupPlate
PupPlate is a Python desktop application that helps pet owners keep track of their dog's feeding schedule, food intake, and nutritional information. It is built using PyQt5 and is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.

# Features
Feeding Schedule
The Feeding Schedule feature allows pet owners to keep track of their dog's feeding times and the amount of food they should be given. The schedule is displayed in a scrollable widget, with an "Add Feeding" button that allows the user to add new feedings as needed.

## Food Intake Tracker
The Food Intake Tracker feature allows pet owners to record the amount of food their dog has eaten at each feeding. This information is displayed in a calendar view, making it easy to see patterns and track changes in the dog's appetite.

## Nutritional Information
The Nutritional Information feature allows pet owners to view detailed information about the nutritional content of the dog food they are using. This includes information about calories, protein, fat, and other nutrients.

## Back to Home Screen Button
The app features a "Back to Home Screen" button that allows users to quickly return to the main screen and navigate to other features of the app.

# To Do
- Add the ability to set reminders for feeding times
- Incorporate a database to allow for saving and loading of feeding schedules
- Add the ability to track the dog's weight over time
- Incorporate a calculator to help users determine the appropriate amount of food for their dog based on their weight, age, and activity level
- Allow users to set custom nutritional targets based on their dog's specific dietary needs

# Installation
To run the application, you will need to have Python 3 and PyQt5 installed on your machine. You can install PyQt5 using pip:

```code
pip install PyQt5
```
Once you have PyQt5 installed, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the main.py file:
